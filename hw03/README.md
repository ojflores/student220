# Homework 3: CSS Layout

Your single task for this assignment is to make your own stylesheet for the [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/).
Start by creating a rough sketch of your layout (either on paper or online).
Submit a photo or screen shot of your sketch as _zen-template.xxx_ (where xxx is the appropriate graphics extension).
Then create your CSS style sheet, submitting it as _zen-stylesheet.css_.
You may use the CSS template they give you as a starting point, but you should erase the CSS rules they provide for those selectors and write your own.
Be sure that your submission satisfies the following requirements:

* You must use the following CSS properties (or a variant thereof) at least once: 
    ++++**margin**, ++++**border**, **padding**, ++++**float**, ++++**position**, **top**, ++++**left**, ++++**display**
* Use _context_ and _attribute_ selectors each at least once.
* Make sure your stylesheet presents a usable, readable page that is easy to understand.
* Most of the stylesheets featured on the Zen Garden website are very polished.
    As this is not a graphics design class, you are not expected to achieve that level of presentation.
    However, you should utilize some graphical/color elements and do your best to created a professional looking product.

Please also pay attention to the following notes.

* Do **NOT** modify the HTML.
* Before you begin this assignment, but after you have viewed the attached document, estimate the time you believe it will take you to complete the assignment.
    Then log your time and submit both your initial estimate and the final time that it took.
    Include the estimate in the markdown file called **ASSIGNMENT.md**.
* View the assignment rubric by clicking on the "Syllabus" on D2L.
* Be sure to utilize appropriate web standards and validate your HTML and CSS.
