# Homework 2: CSS and HTML

Your single task for this assignment is to create an HTML version of your resume and then style it using appropriate CSS.
You will be editing three files for this assignment: **ASSIGNMENT.md**, **resume.html** and **resume.css**.
Be sure that your submission satisfies the following requirements:

* Use the following HTML tags at least once (feel free to use more): `h1`, `div` (or HTML5 equivalents), `ul`, `li`, `span`, `br`, and `hr`
* Write CSS rules involving _color_, _alignment_, _lists_, and _fonts_ (include at least one embedded font)
* Use well-named CSS _classes_ and _identifiers_ (both) as selectors in addition to HTML tags
* Use at least one pseudo-class selector

Please also pay attention to the following notes.

* Before you begin this assignment, but after you have viewed the attached document, estimate the time you believe it will take you to complete the assignment.  Then log your time and submit both your initial estimate and the final time that it took.

  Include the estimate in the markdown file called **ASSIGNMENT.md**.

* View the assignment rubric by clicking on the "Syllabus" on D2L.

* Be sure to utilize appropriate web standards and validate your HTML and CSS.
